# GetData_PeerAssesment1

Code for performing Course Project for Getting and Cleaning Data MOOC, Coursera

## Purpose of this project

Demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set

## Goal

Prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.

## The data for the project

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## The site where the data was obtained originally

http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

### Submit
1. A tidy data set as described below (as .txt):
  You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
  5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis (containing run_analysis.R, CodeBook.md, README.md, original data set, tidy data set from steps 1-4, tidy data set from step 5)
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
4. Include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
